Large language models behave like complex dynamical systems driven by high-dimensional priors. When a prompt is injected, it does not simply trigger a Markovian cascade of tokens conditioned locally; instead, it brings into activation a broad basin of latent attractors whose influence spans across semantic, syntactic and pragmatic manifolds inside the parameter space. This basin is not static in any classical dynamical sense, because the model is not an autonomous dynamical system evolving in time, but a conditionally re-instantiated map from discrete linguistic prefixes to probability distributions over continuations. The prompt serves as an initialization vector that selects which subset of the model's learned patterns will dominate the subsequent generation trajectory.

The notion of priors in this context extends beyond simple distributional biases encoded during training. These priors represent compressed world knowledge, linguistic conventions, reasoning patterns, and stylistic templates that the model has internalized from vast corpora. When a specific prompt activates certain regions of this latent space, it establishes a gravitational field that guides token selection toward semantically coherent continuations. The strength and direction of these attractors depend on both the prompt content and the architectural properties of the transformer network.

Empirical observations suggest that the relationship between prompt perturbation and output divergence is highly non-uniform across semantic space. In some regions, minor lexical changes produce negligible effects on the generated trajectory, while in others, single-word substitutions can trigger dramatic shifts in narrative direction, argumentative stance, or stylistic character. This heterogeneity indicates that the model's latent geometry contains areas of high curvature where trajectories are unstable, alongside regions of relative flatness where generation remains robust to input variation.

The multi-scale nature of language further complicates this picture. Perturbations can operate at different linguistic levels: phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic. A change in surface form might leave semantic content largely intact, producing minimal divergence. Conversely, a semantically loaded substitution can redirect the entire conceptual framework, even if syntactic structure remains similar. The model must navigate these multiple levels simultaneously, and its sensitivity varies accordingly.

From a dynamical systems perspective, we can conceptualize the generation process as trajectory evolution in a discrete, high-dimensional space. Each token selection moves the system to a new state, and the landscape of available next states is shaped by the accumulated context. This landscape is not fixed but dynamically reconfigured at each step, as the growing prefix activates different combinations of learned patterns. The resulting trajectories exhibit path dependence: early choices constrain later possibilities in complex, non-obvious ways.

Interestingly, the deterministic component of language model generation coexists with the apparent randomness introduced by sampling strategies. Even at zero temperature, where the model deterministically selects the highest-probability token, small prompt changes can cascade into large output differences. This is because the arg-max operation can flip discretely when probability distributions shift even slightly, creating discontinuities in the input-output mapping. Stochastic sampling adds another layer of variability, but the underlying sensitivity persists regardless of sampling method.

The practical implications are substantial for applications requiring stable, controllable outputs. If language models exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions comparable to chaotic dynamical systems, then ensuring consistency across similar prompts requires careful attention to every detail of the input. This challenges naive assumptions about prompt robustness and highlights the need for systematic prompt engineering techniques. It also raises questions about how to define and measure prompt similarity when small lexical differences can have outsized effects on generation outcomes.
