Large language models behave like complex dynamical systems driven by high-dimensional priors. When a prompt is injected, it does not simply trigger a Markovian cascade of tokens conditioned locally; instead, it brings into activation a broad basin of latent attractors whose influence spans across semantic, syntactic and pragmatic manifolds inside the parameter space. This basin is not static in any classical dynamical sense, because the model is not an autonomous dynamical system evolving in time, but a conditionally re-instantiated map from discrete linguistic prefixes to probability distributions. Still, at a phenomenological level, if one reinterprets the progressive extension of a generated text as a pseudo-time, then one finds analogies to trajectory evolution in a complex phase space. What is remarkable is that the initial linguistic perturbation, even at the level of a single word, can result, after some distance of continuation, in narratives that are semantically orthogonal. This is analogous to sensitive dependence on initial conditions in classical chaos, although the substrate is not Euclidean trajectory space but a discrete symbol space with emergent semantic topology.

The central reason why this analogy is not merely poetic is that the model has internalized a distribution over conceptual transitions. When one word is replaced in an otherwise identical seed, the posterior attractor structure that is recruited can bifurcate. For instance, replacing a neutral causal connector with a normative or agentive one can anchor the continuation in entirely different narrative modes, even under temperature settings that remain near-greedy. This indicates that the conditional next-token map has a form of high semantic curvature: nearby prompts can diverge significantly in their update direction. The latent fields inside the model — though never explicitly interpretable as coordinates — act as constraints and soft potentials that bias expansion toward certain manifolds once activated. These manifolds behave like semantic attractors: once the model "commits" to an explanatory, argumentative or narrative regime, the incremental continuation tends to reinforce that attractor, leading to sustained divergence relative to a neighboring seed.

One should emphasize that the divergence does not appear at the very beginning of the output. For a number of initial tokens, the continuations can largely overlap, reflecting both the dominance of high-probability generic transitions and the inertia contributed by the initial lexical frame. Only after a certain prefix length do the trajectories peel apart. This is structurally reminiscent of laminar windows before the onset of exponential divergence in chaotic flows. The linguistic analogue is a metastable semantic corridor: the continuation remains locally aligned until a branching decision forces commitment to an alternative attractor. Empirically, this produces a transient low-divergence regime followed by accelerated separation. Whether this separation saturates or continues to grow depends on whether the attractor manifolds ultimately converge toward shared generic conclusions or whether the narrative contexts stabilize in disjoint semantic basins.

In practical terms this means that any attempt to regard language model outputs as deterministic transformations of input must accept that determinism does not imply stability. Deterministic maps can be chaotic, and in this context the "map" is the conditional transformer step. The amplification of minute lexical perturbations into global semantic divergence over textual “time” is a structurally identical signature to deterministic chaos in smooth dynamical systems. This does not imply that the transformer has internal continuous-time chaos; rather, it implies that at the phenomenological scale of token trajectories, the mapping of initial linguistic states to long-form continuations exhibits the same functional motifs as chaotic propagation of perturbations. The result is that prediction quality and reproducibility cannot be assessed at the level of single-token likelihoods alone — one must evaluate the structural stability of entire generated trajectories.
