Large language models behave like complex dynamical systems governed by high-dimensional priors. When a prompt is injected, it does not simply trigger a Markovian cascade of tokens conditioned locally; instead, it brings into activation a broad basin of latent attractors whose influence spans across semantic, syntactic and pragmatic manifolds inside the parameter space. These priors function as implicit constraints that shape the trajectory of text generation, biasing the model toward certain patterns of linguistic structure and content organization. Unlike stochastic processes that evolve through random perturbations, the generation dynamics are fundamentally governed by learned regularities that impose order on the otherwise intractable space of possible token sequences.

The governance structure encoded in these priors reflects the statistical regularities of the training distribution, but also emergent properties arising from the model's architectural inductive biases. Transformer networks, through their attention mechanisms and feedforward layers, implement a form of distributed memory where different components specialize in recognizing and propagating different types of patterns. The interaction between these components creates a rich dynamical landscape where prompt variations can have vastly different effects depending on which specialized circuits are activated.

Consider the distinction between being "driven" versus "governed" by priors. Being driven suggests a more passive, mechanistic response to statistical pressures, where the model simply follows the most probable paths dictated by training data frequencies. Being governed implies a more structured, rule-like constraint system where coherence requirements and compositional principles actively shape generation. The latter perspective better captures the model's ability to produce novel, contextually appropriate text that goes beyond mere pattern matching.

This governance manifests in several observable phenomena. First, the model maintains long-range dependencies and thematic coherence across extended generations, suggesting the activation of high-level organizational schemas. Second, it respects syntactic and semantic constraints even in low-probability contexts, indicating that structural rules are enforced beyond simple n-gram statistics. Third, it exhibits systematic generalization to novel combinations, demonstrating that the priors capture abstract compositional principles rather than just memorized templates.

The dynamical perspective illuminates how these priors interact during generation. As the model processes each new token, it updates its internal representation of the context, which in turn modulates the influence of different prior components. This creates a feedback loop where the evolving trajectory both depends on and shapes the governing constraints. Certain prompts may activate priors that reinforce each other, leading to stable, coherent generation. Others may activate conflicting priors, resulting in more variable or unpredictable outputs.

From an information-theoretic viewpoint, the priors compress vast amounts of linguistic knowledge into the model's parameters, and the prompt serves as a key that decompresses specific aspects of this knowledge. The decompression process is not simply retrieval but involves dynamic computation that adapts the general patterns to the specific context. This adaptation process introduces sensitivity: slightly different prompts may trigger different decompression pathways, leading to divergent outputs.

The hierarchical nature of language adds further complexity. Priors operate at multiple levels simultaneously: word choice, phrase structure, sentence formation, paragraph organization, and discourse-level patterns. A prompt perturbation that seems minor at one level may have cascading effects at higher levels. For instance, changing a single word might shift the implied genre, which then influences subsequent stylistic choices throughout the generation.

Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing more robust and controllable language generation systems. If we can characterize how different types of priors interact and how prompts activate them, we can design better interfaces for steering model behavior and develop techniques for ensuring consistency across related inputs.
